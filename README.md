## Problem Statement

In a campus environment, students often face issues related to **hostel, mess, Wi-Fi, academics, labs, and infrastructure**.

Common challenges include:
- Delayed resolutions  
- Lack of transparency in complaint tracking  
- No centralized platform for submission  
- Limited admin oversight  

Students need an easy way to report issues (anonymously or with details), attach proof, and track status.  
Admins need tools to manage, update, and respond to complaints efficiently.

## Objective

Build a simple, secure web portal for campus complaints that:
- Enables students to submit issues easily (with or without identity)  
- Provides anonymity option for sensitive cases  
- Allows admins to view all complaints, track progress, update status, and reply  
- Ensures real-time visibility of status and responses for both sides  

**Outcome**: Faster resolution and better communication on campus.

## Target Users

- **Students**  
  - Primary users  
  - Submit complaints  
  - View status of own complaints  
  - Optional anonymity  

- **Admin / Faculty / Warden**  
  - Reviewers & resolvers  
  - View all complaints  
  - Update status (Open → In Progress → Resolved)  
  - Add replies / comments  

## Core Features

- User Authentication (Login/Logout with session management)  
- Complaint Submission (title, category, description, photo upload, anonymous option, optional email)  
- Student Dashboard (view own complaints, filters, stats)
